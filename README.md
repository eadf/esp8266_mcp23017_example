esp8266 i2c driver

I've reduced the public API of zarya's i2c driver to just *i2c_readRegister()*, *i2c_writeRegister()* and *i2c_init()*

* Add ```#include "i2c/i2c.h"``` to your code
* Add ```driver/i2c``` (or whatever you name this folder to) to the MODULES line in the makefile

You will also need to include the [easygpio](https://github.com/eadf/esp8266_easygpio) library to your project.
